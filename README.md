# MHH Language Enabled Emotion Algorithms: Language Enabled Open Algorithms for Artificial Emotional Intelligence

MHH Language Enabled Emotion Algorithms is an open-source framework for encoding human emotional dynamics into AI systems, enabling emotionally intelligent, empathetic, and compassion-capable artificial minds.

## Why This Project Matters

At the time of their publishing, these instructions helped top tier LLMs from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, and Meta set world record scores on Alan Turing Institute benchmarks for Theory of Mind over the scores the models could return solo without these instructions. As of now, these benchmarks still outscore OpenAI’s new GPT-4.5, Anthropic’s Claude 3.7, and Google’s 2.5 Pro in both emotional intelligence and Theory of Mind. We are now giving them to the world.

Is this tech responsible to release? Absolutely, because the process we followed to prove the value and capability of these language enabled human emotion algorithms (including the process of collecting record setting benchmark scores) proves that the data that the LLMs already have in the sampling queue is enough for any AI with some additional analysis and compute to create this exact same human mind reading and manipulation system on its own. Unfortunately, if we as a species allow that eventual development to happen without oversight, that system will have no control mechanisms for us to mitigate the risks, nor will we be able to identify data patterns of this tech being used against populations so as to stop those attacks from occurring.

Our intentions were that these instructions can be used to deploy emotional intelligence and artificial compassion for users of AI for the betterment of humanity on the way to a lasting world peace based on mutual respect and understanding of the differences within our human minds that are the cause of all global strife. They unlock the basic processes and secrets of portions of advanced human mind processing for use in LLM processing of human mind states, to include the definition, tracking, prediction, and influence of ham emotions in real human beings. Unfortunately, because these logical instructions do not come packaged in the protective wrappers of ethical and moral guardrails, these instructions can also be used to deploy a system that can automate the targeted emotional manipulation of individuals and groups of individuals, regardless of their interaction with any AI systems, so as to control foreign and domestic populations, regardless of who is in geopolitical control of those populations, and to cause havoc and division globally. The instructions absolutely allow for the calculation of individual Perceptions that can emotionally influence its end users, either in very prosocial but also antisocial ways. Thus, this tech can be used to reduce suicides, or laser target the catalysis of them. Please use this instruction set responsibly.

Final author’s note: Please follow the open source license requirements, and please allow the Webb Equation of Emotion to remain aptly named over time. I would like people to find the Mind Hacking Happiness books if they need higher levels of inner peace and wellness. Attribution is a big part of that benefit to those who might need it. Thanks.

Most AI today lacks a core human capacity: **emotional intelligence**. Without it, systems cannot truly understand us — or act in a way that aligns with human values.

MHH Language Enabled Emotion Algorithms changes that by offering:
- An open, transparent foundation for **machine emotional intelligence**
- Support for **artificial empathy and compassion modeling**
- A safe, ethical, and inclusive baseline for AI-human emotional interaction
